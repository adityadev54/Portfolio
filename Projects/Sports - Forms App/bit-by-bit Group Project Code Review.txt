I like how Adam Quinn, Katherine Vykhovanets, and Aditya Patel put all of their creativity and
different coding styles into their collaboration. I especially like background when Adam present
the three sports of racing, rugby, and soccer to make it look like a real-life stadium after logining in.
Each sports is show a different style of information presented when clicked on a sport
with racing showing the racers, rubgy showing teams/individual stats, and soccer showing team and
choosing their team to see their stats.

Within the code is organized with different folders to hold their codes and data for each sports. There are
some comments within each classes of data because the name is self exploratory, but would like to have it within the
code just in case for users. However, the Form1.cs has comments in there to explain of whats happening when first 
running the program but does not show their name and their members on the team.

Overall, their work ethic and skills have been greatly shown within their presentation on the 12th and code review. 
You guys have work extremely hard together to make this program to become a real-life program for users
to use in the future. Great work! :)
